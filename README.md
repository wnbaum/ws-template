# ws-template
This is a node.js socket.io websocket server template.

CLI setup:
```
git clone https://github.com/wnbaum/ws-template
npm install
```

This project utilizes nodemon, so whenever you save a file, the server will be restarted as long as you run the server with the command:
```
npm run dev
```

To start the server normally, use:
```
npm start
```
